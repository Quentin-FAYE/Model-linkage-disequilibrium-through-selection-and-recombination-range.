# Model-linkage-disequilibrium-through-selection-and-recombination-range.
Master Lesson project of Population genetic and genomic lesson of the MODE BEE maste. : 

Context :
Selection affects allele dynamics. Because of the physical linkage, selection will also affect 
polymorphic sites in the vicinity of the target of selection, even if this variation is neutral. 
Such polymorphisms are thus indirectly affected by selection and we often use the term of 
linked selection to describe this indirect effect. Linked selection can thus affect pattern of 
neutral genetic diversity, especially when recombination is low, and thus generates 
heterogeneity in polymorphism patterns across a genome. The objective of the project is to 
study how different forms of selection can affect linked neutral variation. You will study a 
two-locus model with one locus under selection and one neutral locus. You will investigate 
how the neutral polymorphism is affected by the form and strength of selection and the 
genetic distance between the two loci. You will discuss your results in relation to the analysis 
of genomic patterns of diversity.
